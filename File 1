About this project: This program will calculate the NFL passer rating for 2 quarterbacks using the real formula used in the National Football League.
The program will display the passer rating for each quarterback, and then prints a message detailing who's rating was the best, and what the difference between the ratings was. 
The program will then allow the user to repeat this process, if they choose.
Assumptions: (write any assumptions made here (ex: assumes correct user input))
